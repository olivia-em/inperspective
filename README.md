### Lessons in Perspective

I’m currently working on a web based poetry collection for the courses Code Your Way & Computational Approaches to Narrative. It’s about how the way you let people treat you may be connected to your past. I’m really interested in poetics beyond words, and how metaphor or meaning can be conveyed through structure as well. This is the basis of concrete poetry, but I want to push past that and explore how interactivity, three dimensionality, or other forms of dynamics might carry meaning in new ways.

Note: This is in progress for the end of the semester, so some content and interaction is missing or will be changed. Currently you can click to zoom in on specific objects, zoom in and out, rotate objects, and rotate the scene.
